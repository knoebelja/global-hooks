# React Hooks - Global State Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses React Hooks to implement a global store.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` runs the app in the development mode on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- `npm test` launches the test runner. There are currently no tests.
- `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
